    <p>I Love Pineapple!</p>
    <p>Pineapple, Ananas Comosus is native to Southern Brazil and Paraguay.</p>

    <p>Christopher Columbus is credited with the discovery of this sweet fruit,
      named for its resembelance to the pinecone, in 1493.</p>

    <p>Historically, Hawaii was the world's largest pineapple producer and source
      for U.S. pineapples. Today the largest producers include the Philippines,
      Brazil, and Costa Rica. Fruit from Hawaii or Central America tends to be freshest.</p>

    <p>If you want the sweetest, juiciest pineapple picks, keep in mind fruit from Hawaii or
      Central America tends to be freshest.</p>

    <p>
      When selecting a pineapple, pass over sour-smelling or bruised pineapples.
      To make your pineapple softer and juicier, keep it at room temperature for
      1 or 2 days before cutting.</p>

    <p>In addition to the pineapples, golden, juicy, delicious goodness, it is
      also good for you. A couple of the Pineapples benefits - they contain
      bromelain, an enzyme that may help arthritis pain by easing inflammation.
      They are also a good source of vitamin C, which helps your immune system.</p>
